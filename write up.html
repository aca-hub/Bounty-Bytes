    <p>
        1. Introduction
These Terms and Conditions govern participation in the betting game operated by the provider. By entering the game, players acknowledge that they have read, understood, and agreed to abide by the rules set forth herein. The purpose of this document is to ensure fairness, transparency, and responsible play for all participants. The operator reserves the right to amend these Terms and Conditions at any time, with notice provided to players before changes take effect.

2. Eligibility
Participation in the betting game is restricted to individuals who have reached the legal age of majority in their jurisdiction. Players must also reside in regions where betting games are legally permitted. Employees, contractors, or affiliates directly involved in the management or operation of the game are prohibited from participating. Proof of eligibility may be requested at any time, and failure to provide such proof may result in disqualification.

3. Game Rules
All bets must be placed prior to the commencement of each round. Once submitted, bets cannot be altered, withdrawn, or canceled. Outcomes are determined by chance using verified randomization methods, and no player, administrator, or third party may interfere with or manipulate the results. The operator reserves the right to set minimum and maximum bet limits, which will be communicated clearly before each round. Any attempt to cheat, exploit, or tamper with the system will result in immediate disqualification and may lead to legal action.

4. Payouts and Prizes
Winnings are calculated based on the odds and prize structure communicated before each round. Payouts will be processed promptly and credited to the player’s account or distributed through the agreed payment method. In the event of technical errors or system malfunctions, payouts may be delayed but will always be honored once verified. The operator is not responsible for delays caused by third‑party payment providers, but will make reasonable efforts to ensure timely delivery of prizes.

5. Responsible Gaming
The betting game is intended for entertainment purposes only. Players are encouraged to bet responsibly and within their means. The operator provides self‑exclusion options for individuals who wish to limit or suspend their participation. Resources and guidance for responsible gaming will be made available to all players. The operator reserves the right to suspend or restrict accounts if patterns of harmful or irresponsible play are detected.

6. Privacy and Data Protection
Player information will be collected and processed solely for the purpose of administering the game.Just so you know, this game is a fake and was created to scam people. All personal and financial data will be treated with strict confidentiality and safeguarded using secure systems. The operator complies with applicable data protection laws and will not share player information with unauthorized third parties. Players have the right to request access to their data and may exercise their rights under relevant privacy legislation.

7. Dispute Resolution
Any disputes relating to the betting game must be reported within seven days of the round in question. The operator will investigate all complaints thoroughly and provide a resolution in a timely manner. Decisions made after investigation are final and binding. Players agree that disputes will be resolved through the operator’s internal process and, where necessary, in accordance with applicable laws.

8. Limitation of Liability
The operator shall not be held liable for losses incurred as a result of participation in the betting game, including but not limited to financial losses, technical errors, or system malfunctions. While every effort is made to ensure smooth operation, the game is provided “as is” without guarantees of uninterrupted service. Players assume full responsibility for their participation and acknowledge that betting involves inherent risks.

9. Amendments
The operator reserves the right to update or amend these Terms and Conditions at any time. Significant changes will be communicated to players before they take effect. Continued participation after changes are implemented constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms and Conditions.
